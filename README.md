#Description

In the front end, I have created a simple web page that contains a text box to enter a long URL. On clicking the "Shorten" button, the URL will get shortened and displayed on the same page. Additionally, I have added a "Redirect" button, which redirects the user to the long URL by inputting the shortened URL.
However, during the testing phase, I encountered a CORS error. This error message indicates that the browser is blocking a request made from a web page due to a security feature. I have implemented a solution to overcome this issue by setting the appropriate headers in the Node.js backend.
